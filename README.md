# Delivery Delay Analysis

## 👋 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing delivery time data to identify operational delays, recurring patterns, and opportunities for process improvement.  
The goal is not only to analyze data, but to translate insights into actionable decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify where delivery delays occur
- Detect factors that impact delivery performance
- Propose improvements based on data-driven insights

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset represents simulated operational data, including:
- Order volume
- Delivery times
- Process stages
- Priority levels

This type of data is commonly found in logistics and operations environments.

## ❓ Key Questions
- At which stage do most delays happen?
- How does order volume affect delivery time?
- Are urgent orders being handled efficiently?
- What patterns repeat over time?

## 🔍 Analysis & Insights
- Delays are concentrated in specific process stages
- Peak workload days significantly increase delivery time
- Lack of prioritization negatively impacts urgent deliveries
- Bottlenecks become visible when volume increases

## ✅ Recommendations
- Implement priority rules for urgent orders
- Balance workload during high-volume periods
- Track delivery time KPIs on a weekly basis
- Use dashboards to monitor process performance

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Excel / Google Sheets
- SQL (data exploration and queries)
- Power BI (data visualization)

## 📌 Key Takeaway
Data analysis is most valuable when it leads to better decisions and process improvements, not just reports.
