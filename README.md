Data Analyst focused on decision-making, process improvement, and system optimization.  
I work with data to detect patterns, uncover inefficiencies, and translate complexity into clear actions.

## 🧠 How I think
- I approach data as a system, not isolated numbers
- I focus on insights that drive decisions, not just reports
- I value clarity, structure, and actionable outcomes
