### Data & Process Analyst  
Decision-making · Lean Six Sigma · Systems Thinking

I help teams make better decisions by improving processes with data.  
My focus is not on dashboards, but on **clarity, judgment, and impact**.

I work at the intersection of **data analysis, process improvement, and systems thinking**.

## 🧠 How I think about analysis

I don’t start with data.  
I start with the decision that needs to be made.

- I frame business problems before touching the data  
- I translate operational issues into analytical questions  
- I focus on root causes, not symptoms  
- If an analysis doesn’t change an action, it’s not an insight

This flow represents how I approach analytics work:

- Clearly define the problem  
- Formulate actionable hypotheses  
- Validate them with data  
- Support concrete decisions  
- Measure impact on processes and systems

## ⚙️ What I work on

- Operational and process analysis  
- Identifying inefficiencies and bottlenecks  
- Exploratory data analysis for decision support  
- Connecting data insights with process and financial impact

## 🧰 Tools (chosen based on the problem)

I don’t believe in fixed stacks.  
I choose tools based on the decision that needs to be made.

- **SQL** – data exploration and hypothesis validation  
- **Excel** – fast analysis, modeling, and sanity checks  
- **Power BI** – shared visibility for decision-making  
- **Lean Six Sigma** – process improvement and variability reduction  
- **Accounting background** – understanding financial impact behind operations

## 🧭 Personal principle

> Data is only valuable when it leads to better decisions.
